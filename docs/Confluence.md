### Work Order Management Example (Phone Repair Shop)

A phone repair business would use the platform as follows:

1. **Setup**: The tenant (repair shop) defines work categories like "Screen Repair", "Battery Replacement", etc., and creates status workflows for each category.

2. **Customer Arrival**: When a customer brings in a device for repair:
   - The shop creates a customer record (or updates existing one)
   - They create a work order, selecting the appropriate work category
   - They add specific details about the device (model, damage, etc.)
   - The system generates a unique tracking link

3. **Customer Communication**: The system automatically sends the customer an email or SMS with a tracking link to monitor repair progress.

4. **Repair Process**: As the repair progresses:
   - Staff update the work order status (e.g., from "Waiting" to "In Repair")
   - They can add internal notes about parts needed or technical issues
   - They can add customer-facing updates when appropriate
   - Each status change is logged in the work order history

5. **Completion**: When the repair is finished:
   - Staff update the status to "Ready for Pickup"
   - The customer is automatically notified
   - Upon pickup, the status is changed to "Completed"

6. **Customer Experience**: Throughout this process, the customer can:
   - Check their repair status anytime via the tracking link
   - See estimated completion times
   - View the history of status changes
   - Register for an account to see all their past and current repairs
